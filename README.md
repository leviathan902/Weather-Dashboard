## Story <br>
As a traveler, I want to be able to check the weather forecast for multiple cities, in order to plan accordingly for my trip.

### Requirements ##
* Be able to search the name of a city, and have the current weather, as well as the 5 day forecast for that city display on the page.
* When the search is run, the name of the city, date, and an icon representing the weather will display on page.
* Once searched, a city will be added to the search history.
* The UV index will be color coded to indicate if the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
* When the name of the city is clicked in search history, the weather conditions for that city show up again on screen.
